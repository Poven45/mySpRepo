1. ### Too long of a title but this is for a school project so the fact that its long is okay were helping to hit a non existent word quota
A RPG turn based combat using scenes to depict various battlefields  and different non-combative zones such as places to regain expended resources or obtain new ones. Using a database to fetch and store player data and records and a live service API such as websocket to allow for two way communication between the server and the client to allow for live sessions with other players.

Vision Statement:

"Made Virtual Combat" is a turn-based RPG designed to provide an engaging, story-driven experience for single players or groups of up to four, where every run feels unique and rewarding. Through strategic turn-based combat, players submit actions to a server for simultaneous resolution, prioritizing speed and move order to create dynamic encounters. Featuring a robust "Build" system, players can customize their characters using loot and items, synergizing abilities to adapt to increasing challenges. The game introduces a dynamic event system that interweaves environmental effects, such as weather or disasters, impacting gameplay and offering preparation opportunities. With an integrated achievement system, players can track personal and global milestones, fostering a sense of community and competition. While inspired by games like Divinity: Original Sin and Slay the Spire, "Made Virtual Combat" stands out by combining collaborative storytelling, evolving challenges, and a global tracking system to ensure a continually fresh and immersive experience.
