    <p>This is the WOU Sr Project for the 2025 Graduates Rowen, Justin, Paul, and Jesus.</p>
    <p>TrustTrade is a social platform that revolutionizes how traders interact by requiring portfolio verification through Plaid integration (optional but highlighted). Users who connect their brokerage accounts get a "Verified Portfolio" badge, displaying their real-time portfolio value, current stock positions, option contracts, and quantity of holdings. This verification system creates a hierarchy of trust, where verified users' posts and analyses carry more weight than unverified accounts. The platform would feature a "Performance Score" that tracks verified users' trading history, win rates, and risk-adjusted returns, making it impossible to fake success. Users can create detailed trade journals with entry/exit points, reasoning, and outcome analysis, all backed by verified transaction data.</p>
